Unlimited Image/Screenshot Uploads\nThis functionality is exceptionally useful when troubleshooting coding errors. I can simultaneously upload screenshots of both my code and the error messages, providing context that enables more accurate and helpful responses from the AI.\n2. Multiple File Upload Capability\nThe ability to upload entire lecture notes or project files allows me to seek clarification on complex topics or get assistance with organizing my study materials. This feature transforms DeepSeek into a personalized study assistant that understands my specific course content.\n3. Cost-Free Accessibility\nAs a student with limited disposable income, having access to a powerful, free GenAI tool is invaluable. DeepSeek provides sophisticated AI assistance without financial barriers, making advanced technology accessible for learning and problem-solving.\n\n\n\nUsing DeepSeek has enhanced my ability to: - Troubleshoot coding problems more efficiently - Clarify complex computing concepts - Organize and synthesize information from lectures - Develop better study habits through structured assistance\nThis experience has shown me how thoughtfully designed GenAI tools can democratize access to knowledge and support diverse learning needs in higher education."
