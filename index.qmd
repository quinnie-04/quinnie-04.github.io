:::

I am a Year 1 Applied Computing student at Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), transitioning from an Accountancy background. I graduated from Temasek Polytechnic with a Diploma in Accountancy.

In my free time, I enjoy reading at cafes and journaling while enjoying food and drinks. My favourite drink is iced matcha latte.
